# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide captures some basic information about the cornerstone technologies used in web development today. 

This simple project acts as a demonstration of the absolute basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in action and was created to help me get familiar with the development process (including Git, coding best practices, and other need-to-knows).

For personal interest, I will revisit this project as a reference to reflect back on once I have completed the coding bootcamp.
